Jekyll can be great when you familiarise yourself with it's pros and cons. 
Also when you are not making a website which is in need of a complicated CMS, 
this is your ticket to heaven. The point is really that Jekyll will tend to 
be loved by people who like it simple.

When you think of a simple web framework, mostly you'll cross out the word 
database in your head. This is really **not the case** though. 
Jekyll stands strong in being a web framework which is using a static style 
of a database. This way you can maintain a simple blog, catalog or any other 
crazy ideas you can come up with.

If that doesn't convince you to use Jekyll, I know what does.
Being a developer, I constantly use GitHub as my main tool.
GitHub, supports websites on a Jekyll platform.

>Free, unlimited and for each project you create.

In other words, putting your freshest piece of work into the spotlight
does not require you to gut your wallet anymore and GitHub totally
has your back on this.

What are you waiting for? Go out, create an account (*even though if you're
not a developer*, it doesn't matter at all!) and hone yourself into Jekyll
content creation!

These links below really helped my out in creating this and maybe
future sites based on this minimalistic dreamware!
